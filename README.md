# KnightHacks-Zen-and-Blake

Thank you for reading this!

This program was originally created with the intent of using generative AI
in order to create images and cross reference them with the internet in order
to allow for users to find what they need based on similarities with what was generated.
Due to insufficient time, alongside with the little experience we have and the limits 
imposed by a two person team, we were unable to complete our full concept design of
the project. That being said, we both hope to continue working on this project as our
skills as programmers develop throughout, and we hope to add the likes of Semantic Kernel,
VectorDB, potentially MondoDB to our project. We also have the vision of being able to run
this program on a server domain, allowing for it to be accessed by the simple use of a website.


    How did we get this idea?
While brainstorming an idea to work on during this event, Zen mentioned the idea that 
sometimes shopping for clothes can be a hassle, especially because sometimes you can 
search for a shirt or dress but not find one to be to your desirability. This is where
our idea came into play -- We wanted to make an interface for users that would allow them
to generate their own clothing ideas, and then cross reference them on the internet to find
similarities in the items for a better shopping experience. We also thought about implications
of such code, and the fact that maybe the generative AI can use these images and companies can
gather data about the users to allow for more specialized products to be made for them. In this
sense, if there is a large demand for a certain type of shirt designed my generation, then a company
may be able to supply that to their customers, allowing for a better overall experience. Furthermore, we
also came to the conclusion that we could allow for our program to support small businesses, such
as local sellers on domains such as Etsy. The theory was that if our program was unable
to match a certain threshold of the object with what the user selected, it would take them 
to an etsy listing looking for similar pages, to allow for local sellers to customize
and personally make those items for our users. 


While we admit we bit off more than we could chew, we learned a lot about generative AI,
and just how magical it really could be. We both walked into this event novices to project
creation, having never used basic tools like Github or OpenAI, and now upon familiarizing 
ourselves with their functionality, we think it's safe to say we won't be going back. This 
being our first Hackathon ever, we really had no clue what to expect. It safe to say that
any expectations we did have were completely blown out of the water, and we look forward
to attending many, many more in the future. 

Although our project under the course of this hackathon has to come to an end, we are not
finished. We came to this event to learn, and while what we were able to accomplish in 36
hours was a lot to us, we know we have barely scraped the surface. We look forward to 
continuing this code and constantly making improvements.

We wanted to thank all the organizers and sponsors of this event, it has truly been magical
and will be looked back on as the push towards a hopefully very successful career in a 
ever-evolving atmosphere of science, Computer Science.
